The primary aim of the project was to design and implement a structured relational database to analyze crime patterns, track criminal activities, and support law enforcement operations.

### **Summary: Crime Analysis Project**

**Objective:**  
The primary aim of the project was to design and implement a structured relational database to analyze crime patterns, track criminal activities, and support law enforcement operations.

### **Key Components:**

1. **Database Design:**  
   - Developed a normalized schema with tables for **Crime**, **Criminal**, **Victim**, and **Officer** to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.  

2. **Data Management:**  
   - Populated the database with realistic data containing at least 100 rows per table, capturing diverse and detailed information.

3. **SQL Query Development:**  
   - Implemented SQL queries to analyze crime data, such as:  
     - Trends in **crime type** and **crime locations**.  
     - Insights into **officer case loads** and **criminal profiles**.  
     - Age and gender-based distributions of victims and criminals.  
   - Optimized queries to enhance performance and reduce execution time.  

4. **Advanced Queries:**  
   - Created **joins**, **subqueries**, and **aggregations** to extract meaningful insights like:  
     - High-crime areas.  
     - Officers handling the most cases.  
     - Recent crimes and arrests.

### **Insights Generated:**
- Identified high-crime locations and most common crime types.  
- Analyzed demographic details such as age and gender for both victims and criminals.  
- Evaluated officer performance and workload distribution.  
- Found connections between crimes, victims, and criminals.
